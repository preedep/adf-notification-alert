# Azure Logic App - ADF Email Notification via Azure Communication Services

This Logic App is designed to handle **ADF pipeline status notifications** (both success and failure) and send emails through **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** with built-in **retry and exponential backoff** logic.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case

This Logic App acts as a common notification endpoint for ADF pipelines across multiple applications in the organization. It supports **three patterns** of notification input:

### üîπ Pattern 1: Custom ADF Web Activity (Managed Identity Auth)
ADF calls this Logic App via HTTP `POST` Web Activity with a defined payload schema. Authentication is handled via **Managed Identity** of ADF.

### üî∏ Pattern 2: Azure Monitor Alert (Common Schema)
Azure Monitor Metric Alerts (e.g., for ADF failures/success) trigger this Logic App using a **secure webhook** (with AAD auth). The Logic App queries **Log Analytics** to enrich the alert before sending the email.

üëâ See Azure Common Alert Schema documentation: [Common Alert Schema Format (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema)

### üîπ Pattern 3: Splunk-Compatible ADF Event with API Key Auth
This new pattern allows integration with systems like Splunk via simple event-based HTTP POST. It uses **API Key authentication** passed in HTTP headers. Logic App validates the `x-api-key` against a secret stored in **Azure Key Vault**.

## üì¨ How It Works

### Pattern 1 - Web Activity Trigger (Custom Payload with Managed Identity)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ADF as Azure Data Factory (ADF)
    participant LogicApp as Azure Logic App
    participant ACS as Azure Communication Services
    participant Email as Recipient

    ADF->>LogicApp: HTTP POST (with Managed Identity)
    LogicApp->>ACS: Send Email
    ACS-->>LogicApp: 202 Accepted (or error)
    LogicApp-->>ADF: Response
    ACS-->>Email: Delivers Email Notification
```

### Pattern 2 - Azure Monitor Alert Trigger
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AzureMonitor as Azure Monitor (Alert)
    participant LogicApp as Azure Logic App
    participant LogAnalytics as Log Analytics
    participant ACS as Azure Communication Services
    participant Email as Recipient

    AzureMonitor->>LogicApp: Secure Webhook (AAD Token)
    LogicApp->>LogAnalytics: Query ADF Status
    LogAnalytics-->>LogicApp: Pipeline Run Details
    LogicApp->>ACS: Send Email
    ACS-->>LogicApp: 202 Accepted (or error)
    ACS-->>Email: Delivers Email Notification
```

### Pattern 3 - API Event via API Key Auth (e.g., Splunk)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System as External System (e.g. Splunk)
    participant LogicApp as Logic App (API Key Auth)
    participant KeyVault as Azure Key Vault
    participant ACS as Azure Communication Services
    participant Email as Email Recipient

    System->>LogicApp: HTTP POST + x-api-key header
    LogicApp->>KeyVault: GET Secret (API Key)
    KeyVault-->>LogicApp: Return Secret
    LogicApp->>LogicApp: Compare keys
    alt Key match
        LogicApp->>ACS: Send Email
        ACS-->>LogicApp: 202 Accepted
        ACS-->>Email: Deliver
    else Key mismatch
        LogicApp-->>System: 403 Forbidden
    end
```

## üßæ Notes When Using the Example Files (`alert_custom.json` / `alert_azure_monitor.json`)

When using these sample alert payloads in your environment, make sure you:

1. üîê **Configure your verified sender properly**:
    ```json
    "senderAddress": "DoNotReply@preedee.space"
    ```
    Replace `DoNotReply@preedee.space` with your **verified sender email address** registered in **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**.

2. üßë‚Äçüíº **Specify actual recipient addresses**:
    ```json
    "recipients": {
        "to": [
            {
                "address": "XXX",
                "displayName": "XXX"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    Replace `XXX` with **valid email addresses** that you want to send the notification to.

3. üìß **Keep placeholders dynamic**:
    Ensure that:
    - `@outputs('Set_Subject')` refers to your dynamic subject
    - `@outputs('Set_Body')` is the dynamic HTML body content generated inside the Logic App workflow.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Azure Communication Services will **reject** email requests using **unverified sender addresses** or malformed payloads.
